Functional testing
------------------
1. field types - verification of all field types. For example, if a particular field requires an integer, then send in a string.
2. required fields - verifies the usefulness of error messages 
3. database integrity - corrupt data
4. Scenario tests (use cases (Business driven development (BDD)))
